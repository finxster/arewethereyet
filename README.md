When applying for the H1B visa, I was really anxious about my visa status.

It is possible to check it online in https://egov.uscis.gov/, using your application id. So I've created this script to check the status for me, instead going every time into a browser and typing my application id.

# usage
Just replace `<APPLICATION_ID>` with your application id and execute the script.

Any doubts/suggestions, please fill a PR, Issue or send me and email.
